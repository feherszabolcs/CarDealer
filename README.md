## Getting Started

Welcome to the CD Cardealer project. Uni project, small errors/typos may can be found. 

## Folder Structure

A structure of the project is looking like:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
  - `model`: location of the main Vehicle model and related utilities
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
